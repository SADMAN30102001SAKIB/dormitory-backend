But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

  "reply": "Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)\n\nEach of these 'expert' trees looks at slightly different, random parts of the data, which helps them learn different things. By combining their insights, the Random Forest algorithm becomes much more accurate and less prone to making mistakes compared to just one tree. It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)\n\nIt's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: what is the deadline for bdapps innovation summit?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit deadline, that's a cool thing to be looking into! So, it looks like there are a couple of dates to keep in mind. The good news is that the **Online Registration Deadline** for initial registration is actually **today, June 30th, 2025**! So, if you're thinking of getting involved, now's the time to do it! (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It also seems like the deadline to submit your actual idea or app was May 31st, 2025 (External Context 1), so you might be looking at the initial registration part. They'll be announcing the top 20 shortlisted teams on July 5th, 2025 (External Context 1). 

Are you thinking of submitting an idea? It sounds like a fantastic opportunity, especially since you're at RUET and might be into tech! Let me know if you need help finding the registration link or anything else! üòä
User: what is Random Forest?
Bot: Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning! Are you learning about machine learning at RUET, or perhaps working on a project that involves it? It's a fantastic area to dive into!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: what is the deadline for bdapps innovation summit?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit deadline, that's a cool thing to be looking into! So, it looks like there are a couple of dates to keep in mind. The good news is that the **Online Registration Deadline** for initial registration is actually **today, June 30th, 2025**! So, if you're thinking of getting involved, now's the time to do it! (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It also seems like the deadline to submit your actual idea or app was May 31st, 2025 (External Context 1), so you might be looking at the initial registration part. They'll be announcing the top 20 shortlisted teams on July 5th, 2025 (External Context 1). 

Are you thinking of submitting an idea? It sounds like a fantastic opportunity, especially since you're at RUET and might be into tech! Let me know if you need help finding the registration link or anything else! üòä
User: what is Random Forest?
Bot: Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

Each of these 'expert' trees looks at slightly different, random parts of the data, which helps them learn different things. By combining their insights, the Random Forest algorithm becomes much more accurate and less prone to making mistakes compared to just one tree. It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning! Are you learning about machine learning at RUET, or perhaps working on a project that involves it? It's a fantastic area to dive into!
Bot: Hey there again! It looks like you're really curious about Random Forest, which is awesome! Sometimes it takes a couple of passes to really get a grasp on these cool machine learning concepts, and that's totally okay. üòä

To quickly recap, remember we talked about Random Forest being like a 'committee of experts' (many decision trees) working together instead of just one. Each 'expert' looks at the data a bit differently, and then they all 'vote' to come up with the best prediction. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

What makes it super powerful is that by having all these different trees, it becomes much more robust and less likely to get 'tricked' by the specific quirks of the data (this is called reducing 'overfitting'). It's also great because it can handle lots of different types of data, and it can even tell you which features in your data are most important for making predictions! It's used in so many places, from healthcare to finance to recommendation systems.

Are you diving deeper into machine learning concepts for a course at RUET, or perhaps thinking about a project where you might use something like Random Forest? It's a field with so much potential, and it's fantastic that you're exploring it!

Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:

User: what is Random Forest?
Bot: Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

Each of these 'expert' trees looks at slightly different, random parts of the data, which helps them learn different things. By combining their insights, the Random Forest algorithm becomes much more accurate and less prone to making mistakes compared to just one tree. It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning! Are you learning about machine learning at RUET, or perhaps working on a project that involves it? It's a fantastic area to dive into!
Bot: Hey there again! It looks like you're really curious about Random Forest, which is awesome! Sometimes it takes a couple of passes to really get a grasp on these cool machine learning concepts, and that's totally okay. üòä

To quickly recap, remember we talked about Random Forest being like a 'committee of experts' (many decision trees) working together instead of just one. Each 'expert' looks at the data a bit differently, and then they all 'vote' to come up with the best prediction. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

What makes it super powerful is that by having all these different trees, it becomes much more robust and less likely to get 'tricked' by the specific quirks of the data (this is called reducing 'overfitting'). It's also great because it can handle lots of different types of data, and it can even tell you which features in your data are most important for making predictions! It's used in so many places, from healthcare to finance to recommendation systems.

Are you diving deeper into machine learning concepts for a course at RUET, or perhaps thinking about a project where you might use something like Random Forest? It's a field with so much potential, and it's fantastic that you're exploring it!
User: what is Random Forest?
User: bdapps innovation summit 2023 winners
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, that's a great question to follow up on! I've checked the information I have, and it seems to primarily highlight the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025** and some other recent competitions they've held, like the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1).

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:

Bot: Hey there again! It looks like you're really curious about Random Forest, which is awesome! Sometimes it takes a couple of passes to really get a grasp on these cool machine learning concepts, and that's totally okay. üòä

To quickly recap, remember we talked about Random Forest being like a 'committee of experts' (many decision trees) working together instead of just one. Each 'expert' looks at the data a bit differently, and then they all 'vote' to come up with the best prediction. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

What makes it super powerful is that by having all these different trees, it becomes much more robust and less likely to get 'tricked' by the specific quirks of the data (this is called reducing 'overfitting'). It's also great because it can handle lots of different types of data, and it can even tell you which features in your data are most important for making predictions! It's used in so many places, from healthcare to finance to recommendation systems.

Are you diving deeper into machine learning concepts for a course at RUET, or perhaps thinking about a project where you might use something like Random Forest? It's a field with so much potential, and it's fantastic that you're exploring it!
User: what is Random Forest?
User: bdapps innovation summit 2023 winners
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, that's a great question to follow up on! I've checked the information I have, and it seems to primarily highlight the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025** and some other recent competitions they've held, like the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1).
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Bot: Ah, you're asking me to elaborate on why I don't have specific details about the bdapps Innovation Summit **2023** winners, right? Gotcha!

So, the information I have access to is really focused on the most current and upcoming events, like the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025**, and also highlights some of their very recent challenges, such as the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1). Think of it like a news feed that's always showing the latest happenings and what's directly relevant right now.

Because of that, detailed historical results from a couple of years back, like the 2023 winners, aren't specifically included in the current set of information I'm drawing from. If you're super keen to find out about those specific past winners, your best bet would probably be to check the official bdapps website archives or their social media pages. Sometimes organizations post those kinds of detailed historical results there!

Are you perhaps looking for inspiration from past projects, or just curious about the history of the summit? It's really cool that you're digging into this!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: bdapps innovation summit 2023 winners
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, that's a great question to follow up on! I've checked the information I have, and it seems to primarily highlight the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025** and some other recent competitions they've held, like the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1).
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Bot: Ah, you're asking me to elaborate on why I don't have specific details about the bdapps Innovation Summit **2023** winners, right? Gotcha!

So, the information I have access to is really focused on the most current and upcoming events, like the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025**, and also highlights some of their very recent challenges, such as the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1). Think of it like a news feed that's always showing the latest happenings and what's directly relevant right now.

Because of that, detailed historical results from a couple of years back, like the 2023 winners, aren't specifically included in the current set of information I'm drawing from. If you're super keen to find out about those specific past winners, your best bet would probably be to check the official bdapps website archives or their social media pages. Sometimes organizations post those kinds of detailed historical results there!

Are you perhaps looking for inspiration from past projects, or just curious about the history of the summit? It's really cool that you're digging into this!
User: Is architecture CT cancelled?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about an architecture CT being cancelled, that's a really important thing to know! I did find some information that mentions a CT was cancelled at RUET on **June 18th, 2025**, because of a Teachers Training Program that day (Internal Context 1).

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user is an RUET student who found the admission process tough, is feeling distressed and like a failure, and frequently feels down. They are looking for strategies to feel consistently better, specifically hobbies. They are currently sleeping 16 hours a day and are considering reducing it to 13 hours, which Dormie has advised to reduce gradually to a healthier 7-9 hours and seek professional help if needed. The user is also considering shifting to a hostel from home. Previously, the user asked about the deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit (initial online registration deadline is June 30th, 2025, idea/app submission deadline was May 31st, 2025, top 20 announcements on July 5th, 2025). The user then asked for an explanation of 'Random Forest' multiple times, which Dormie explained as a machine learning concept using an ensemble of decision trees. The user then asked about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, and Dormie informed them that the available information focuses on the 2025 summit and other recent challenges, not specifically the 2023 winners. The user then asked Dormie to elaborate on this, which Dormie did by explaining the focus on current information. The user then asked if an architecture CT has been cancelled, and Dormie confirmed a CT was cancelled at RUET on June 18th, 2025, due to a Teachers Training Program (Internal Context 1). The user has now acknowledged this information with 'Cool'.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:
---
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Bot: Ah, you're asking me to elaborate on why I don't have specific details about the bdapps Innovation Summit **2023** winners, right? Gotcha!

So, the information I have access to is really focused on the most current and upcoming events, like the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025**, and also highlights some of their very recent challenges, such as the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1). Think of it like a news feed that's always showing the latest happenings and what's directly relevant right now.

Because of that, detailed historical results from a couple of years back, like the 2023 winners, aren't specifically included in the current set of information I'm drawing from. If you're super keen to find out about those specific past winners, your best bet would probably be to check the official bdapps website archives or their social media pages. Sometimes organizations post those kinds of detailed historical results there!

Are you perhaps looking for inspiration from past projects, or just curious about the history of the summit? It's really cool that you're digging into this!
User: Is architecture CT cancelled?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about an architecture CT being cancelled, that's a really important thing to know! I did find some information that mentions a CT was cancelled at RUET on **June 18th, 2025**, because of a Teachers Training Program that day (Internal Context 1).
User: Cool
Bot: Hey there! "Cool" - glad that information about the CT cancellation was helpful and cleared things up for you! 

Speaking of classes and your studies, how are things generally feeling for you with your courses at RUET these days? I know you mentioned feeling a bit distressed and down earlier, and also thinking about your sleep and maybe even moving to a hostel. How are all these pieces fitting together for you right now? Remember, I'm here to chat about anything that's on your mind, whether it's academics or just how you're feeling. We can always explore strategies to help you feel more consistently better, like finding some cool hobbies or even just managing your daily routine. No pressure at all, just checking in!

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Is architecture CT cancelled?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about an architecture CT being cancelled, that's a really important thing to know! I did find some information that mentions a CT was cancelled at RUET on **June 18th, 2025**, because of a Teachers Training Program that day (Internal Context 1).
User: Cool
Bot: Hey there! "Cool" - glad that information about the CT cancellation was helpful and cleared things up for you! 

Speaking of classes and your studies, how are things generally feeling for you with your courses at RUET these days? I know you mentioned feeling a bit distressed and down earlier, and also thinking about your sleep and maybe even moving to a hostel. How are all these pieces fitting together for you right now? Remember, I'm here to chat about anything that's on your mind, whether it's academics or just how you're feeling. We can always explore strategies to help you feel more consistently better, like finding some cool hobbies or even just managing your daily routine. No pressure at all, just checking in!
User: Cool
Bot: Great!  So, you're feeling pretty good about the CT cancellation news. That's fantastic! It sounds like you're navigating university life pretty well, even with the tough admission process you went through.  Remember how we talked about feeling distressed and down?  It's great that you are tackling that head-on by considering a change of environment by moving to a hostel.  That could be a really positive step.  And we also spoke about gradually reducing your sleep time from 16 hours to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going?  Are you finding a way to make that adjustment?  What are your thoughts about finding some new hobbies to help boost your mood?  Maybe something related to your studies or completely different to help you relax and de-stress. We can brainstorm some ideas if you'd like!

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.
