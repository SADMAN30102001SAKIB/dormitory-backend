But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

  "reply": "Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)\n\nEach of these 'expert' trees looks at slightly different, random parts of the data, which helps them learn different things. By combining their insights, the Random Forest algorithm becomes much more accurate and less prone to making mistakes compared to just one tree. It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)\n\nIt's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: what is the deadline for bdapps innovation summit?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit deadline, that's a cool thing to be looking into! So, it looks like there are a couple of dates to keep in mind. The good news is that the **Online Registration Deadline** for initial registration is actually **today, June 30th, 2025**! So, if you're thinking of getting involved, now's the time to do it! (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It also seems like the deadline to submit your actual idea or app was May 31st, 2025 (External Context 1), so you might be looking at the initial registration part. They'll be announcing the top 20 shortlisted teams on July 5th, 2025 (External Context 1). 

Are you thinking of submitting an idea? It sounds like a fantastic opportunity, especially since you're at RUET and might be into tech! Let me know if you need help finding the registration link or anything else! üòä
User: what is Random Forest?
Bot: Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning! Are you learning about machine learning at RUET, or perhaps working on a project that involves it? It's a fantastic area to dive into!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: what is the deadline for bdapps innovation summit?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit deadline, that's a cool thing to be looking into! So, it looks like there are a couple of dates to keep in mind. The good news is that the **Online Registration Deadline** for initial registration is actually **today, June 30th, 2025**! So, if you're thinking of getting involved, now's the time to do it! (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It also seems like the deadline to submit your actual idea or app was May 31st, 2025 (External Context 1), so you might be looking at the initial registration part. They'll be announcing the top 20 shortlisted teams on July 5th, 2025 (External Context 1). 

Are you thinking of submitting an idea? It sounds like a fantastic opportunity, especially since you're at RUET and might be into tech! Let me know if you need help finding the registration link or anything else! üòä
User: what is Random Forest?
Bot: Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

Each of these 'expert' trees looks at slightly different, random parts of the data, which helps them learn different things. By combining their insights, the Random Forest algorithm becomes much more accurate and less prone to making mistakes compared to just one tree. It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning! Are you learning about machine learning at RUET, or perhaps working on a project that involves it? It's a fantastic area to dive into!
Bot: Hey there again! It looks like you're really curious about Random Forest, which is awesome! Sometimes it takes a couple of passes to really get a grasp on these cool machine learning concepts, and that's totally okay. üòä

To quickly recap, remember we talked about Random Forest being like a 'committee of experts' (many decision trees) working together instead of just one. Each 'expert' looks at the data a bit differently, and then they all 'vote' to come up with the best prediction. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

What makes it super powerful is that by having all these different trees, it becomes much more robust and less likely to get 'tricked' by the specific quirks of the data (this is called reducing 'overfitting'). It's also great because it can handle lots of different types of data, and it can even tell you which features in your data are most important for making predictions! It's used in so many places, from healthcare to finance to recommendation systems.

Are you diving deeper into machine learning concepts for a course at RUET, or perhaps thinking about a project where you might use something like Random Forest? It's a field with so much potential, and it's fantastic that you're exploring it!

Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:

User: what is Random Forest?
Bot: Oh, that's a great question! Shifting gears a bit, huh? Random Forest is a super cool and widely used concept in the world of machine learning. Think of it like this: instead of relying on just one 'expert' (a single decision tree) to make a prediction, Random Forest gathers a whole 'committee' of experts (many decision trees) and lets them all vote or average their results to come up with the final answer. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

Each of these 'expert' trees looks at slightly different, random parts of the data, which helps them learn different things. By combining their insights, the Random Forest algorithm becomes much more accurate and less prone to making mistakes compared to just one tree. It's really flexible too, because you can use it for both figuring out categories (like 'Is this email spam or not?') and predicting numbers (like 'What will the house price be?'). (External Context 1, External Context 2)

It's known for being quite powerful even without a lot of fine-tuning! Are you learning about machine learning at RUET, or perhaps working on a project that involves it? It's a fantastic area to dive into!
Bot: Hey there again! It looks like you're really curious about Random Forest, which is awesome! Sometimes it takes a couple of passes to really get a grasp on these cool machine learning concepts, and that's totally okay. üòä

To quickly recap, remember we talked about Random Forest being like a 'committee of experts' (many decision trees) working together instead of just one. Each 'expert' looks at the data a bit differently, and then they all 'vote' to come up with the best prediction. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

What makes it super powerful is that by having all these different trees, it becomes much more robust and less likely to get 'tricked' by the specific quirks of the data (this is called reducing 'overfitting'). It's also great because it can handle lots of different types of data, and it can even tell you which features in your data are most important for making predictions! It's used in so many places, from healthcare to finance to recommendation systems.

Are you diving deeper into machine learning concepts for a course at RUET, or perhaps thinking about a project where you might use something like Random Forest? It's a field with so much potential, and it's fantastic that you're exploring it!
User: what is Random Forest?
User: bdapps innovation summit 2023 winners
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, that's a great question to follow up on! I've checked the information I have, and it seems to primarily highlight the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025** and some other recent competitions they've held, like the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1).

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:

Bot: Hey there again! It looks like you're really curious about Random Forest, which is awesome! Sometimes it takes a couple of passes to really get a grasp on these cool machine learning concepts, and that's totally okay. üòä

To quickly recap, remember we talked about Random Forest being like a 'committee of experts' (many decision trees) working together instead of just one. Each 'expert' looks at the data a bit differently, and then they all 'vote' to come up with the best prediction. (External Context 1, External Context 2)

What makes it super powerful is that by having all these different trees, it becomes much more robust and less likely to get 'tricked' by the specific quirks of the data (this is called reducing 'overfitting'). It's also great because it can handle lots of different types of data, and it can even tell you which features in your data are most important for making predictions! It's used in so many places, from healthcare to finance to recommendation systems.

Are you diving deeper into machine learning concepts for a course at RUET, or perhaps thinking about a project where you might use something like Random Forest? It's a field with so much potential, and it's fantastic that you're exploring it!
User: what is Random Forest?
User: bdapps innovation summit 2023 winners
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, that's a great question to follow up on! I've checked the information I have, and it seems to primarily highlight the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025** and some other recent competitions they've held, like the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1).
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Bot: Ah, you're asking me to elaborate on why I don't have specific details about the bdapps Innovation Summit **2023** winners, right? Gotcha!

So, the information I have access to is really focused on the most current and upcoming events, like the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025**, and also highlights some of their very recent challenges, such as the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1). Think of it like a news feed that's always showing the latest happenings and what's directly relevant right now.

Because of that, detailed historical results from a couple of years back, like the 2023 winners, aren't specifically included in the current set of information I'm drawing from. If you're super keen to find out about those specific past winners, your best bet would probably be to check the official bdapps website archives or their social media pages. Sometimes organizations post those kinds of detailed historical results there!

Are you perhaps looking for inspiration from past projects, or just curious about the history of the summit? It's really cool that you're digging into this!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: bdapps innovation summit 2023 winners
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, that's a great question to follow up on! I've checked the information I have, and it seems to primarily highlight the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025** and some other recent competitions they've held, like the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1).
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Bot: Ah, you're asking me to elaborate on why I don't have specific details about the bdapps Innovation Summit **2023** winners, right? Gotcha!

So, the information I have access to is really focused on the most current and upcoming events, like the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025**, and also highlights some of their very recent challenges, such as the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1). Think of it like a news feed that's always showing the latest happenings and what's directly relevant right now.

Because of that, detailed historical results from a couple of years back, like the 2023 winners, aren't specifically included in the current set of information I'm drawing from. If you're super keen to find out about those specific past winners, your best bet would probably be to check the official bdapps website archives or their social media pages. Sometimes organizations post those kinds of detailed historical results there!

Are you perhaps looking for inspiration from past projects, or just curious about the history of the summit? It's really cool that you're digging into this!
User: Is architecture CT cancelled?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about an architecture CT being cancelled, that's a really important thing to know! I did find some information that mentions a CT was cancelled at RUET on **June 18th, 2025**, because of a Teachers Training Program that day (Internal Context 1).

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user is an RUET student who found the admission process tough, is feeling distressed and like a failure, and frequently feels down. They are looking for strategies to feel consistently better, specifically hobbies. They are currently sleeping 16 hours a day and are considering reducing it to 13 hours, which Dormie has advised to reduce gradually to a healthier 7-9 hours and seek professional help if needed. The user is also considering shifting to a hostel from home. Previously, the user asked about the deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit (initial online registration deadline is June 30th, 2025, idea/app submission deadline was May 31st, 2025, top 20 announcements on July 5th, 2025). The user then asked for an explanation of 'Random Forest' multiple times, which Dormie explained as a machine learning concept using an ensemble of decision trees. The user then asked about the bdapps Innovation Summit 2023 winners, and Dormie informed them that the available information focuses on the 2025 summit and other recent challenges, not specifically the 2023 winners. The user then asked Dormie to elaborate on this, which Dormie did by explaining the focus on current information. The user then asked if an architecture CT has been cancelled, and Dormie confirmed a CT was cancelled at RUET on June 18th, 2025, due to a Teachers Training Program (Internal Context 1). The user has now acknowledged this information with 'Cool'.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:
---
User: Can you elaborate on that?
Bot: Ah, you're asking me to elaborate on why I don't have specific details about the bdapps Innovation Summit **2023** winners, right? Gotcha!

So, the information I have access to is really focused on the most current and upcoming events, like the ongoing bdapps Innovation Summit for **2025**, and also highlights some of their very recent challenges, such as the 'Rajshahi & Rangpur Champs Competition' and the 'Top Grossing Islamic App Challenge' (External Context 1). Think of it like a news feed that's always showing the latest happenings and what's directly relevant right now.

Because of that, detailed historical results from a couple of years back, like the 2023 winners, aren't specifically included in the current set of information I'm drawing from. If you're super keen to find out about those specific past winners, your best bet would probably be to check the official bdapps website archives or their social media pages. Sometimes organizations post those kinds of detailed historical results there!

Are you perhaps looking for inspiration from past projects, or just curious about the history of the summit? It's really cool that you're digging into this!
User: Is architecture CT cancelled?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about an architecture CT being cancelled, that's a really important thing to know! I did find some information that mentions a CT was cancelled at RUET on **June 18th, 2025**, because of a Teachers Training Program that day (Internal Context 1).
User: Cool
Bot: Hey there! "Cool" - glad that information about the CT cancellation was helpful and cleared things up for you! 

Speaking of classes and your studies, how are things generally feeling for you with your courses at RUET these days? I know you mentioned feeling a bit distressed and down earlier, and also thinking about your sleep and maybe even moving to a hostel. How are all these pieces fitting together for you right now? Remember, I'm here to chat about anything that's on your mind, whether it's academics or just how you're feeling. We can always explore strategies to help you feel more consistently better, like finding some cool hobbies or even just managing your daily routine. No pressure at all, just checking in!

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Is architecture CT cancelled?
Bot: Hey there! You're asking about an architecture CT being cancelled, that's a really important thing to know! I did find some information that mentions a CT was cancelled at RUET on **June 18th, 2025**, because of a Teachers Training Program that day (Internal Context 1).
User: Cool
Bot: Hey there! "Cool" - glad that information about the CT cancellation was helpful and cleared things up for you! 

Speaking of classes and your studies, how are things generally feeling for you with your courses at RUET these days? I know you mentioned feeling a bit distressed and down earlier, and also thinking about your sleep and maybe even moving to a hostel. How are all these pieces fitting together for you right now? Remember, I'm here to chat about anything that's on your mind, whether it's academics or just how you're feeling. We can always explore strategies to help you feel more consistently better, like finding some cool hobbies or even just managing your daily routine. No pressure at all, just checking in!
User: Cool
Bot: Great!  So, you're feeling pretty good about the CT cancellation news. That's fantastic! It sounds like you're navigating university life pretty well, even with the tough admission process you went through.  Remember how we talked about feeling distressed and down?  It's great that you are tackling that head-on by considering a change of environment by moving to a hostel.  That could be a really positive step.  And we also spoke about gradually reducing your sleep time from 16 hours to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going?  Are you finding a way to make that adjustment?  What are your thoughts about finding some new hobbies to help boost your mood?  Maybe something related to your studies or completely different to help you relax and de-stress. We can brainstorm some ideas if you'd like!

Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a new RUET student, is feeling distressed after a difficult admission process. They sleep excessively (16 hours), are considering moving to a hostel, and are seeking hobbies to improve their mood.  We discussed a cancelled architecture CT (confirmed by the user), the bdapps Innovation Summit (missed deadline), Random Forest (machine learning), and the lack of 2023 bdapps winner information.  The user is now seeking information about RUET's mark distribution, which I couldn't fully provide, suggesting they contact the admissions office for precise details.  We've also discussed gradually reducing their sleep to a healthier range (7-9 hours).

User: Cool
Bot: Hey there! "Cool" - glad that information about the CT cancellation was helpful and cleared things up for you! 

Speaking of classes and your studies, how are things generally feeling for you with your courses at RUET these days? I know you mentioned feeling a bit distressed and down earlier, and also thinking about your sleep and maybe even moving to a hostel. How are all these pieces fitting together for you right now? Remember, I'm here to chat about anything that's on your mind, whether it's academics or just how you're feeling. We can always explore strategies to help you feel more consistently better, like finding some cool hobbies or even just managing your daily routine. No pressure at all, just checking in!
User: Cool
Bot: Great!  So, you're feeling pretty good about the CT cancellation news. That's fantastic! It sounds like you're navigating university life pretty well, even with the tough admission process you went through.  Remember how we talked about feeling distressed and down?  It's great that you are tackling that head-on by considering a change of environment by moving to a hostel.  That could be a really positive step.  And we also spoke about gradually reducing your sleep time from 16 hours to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going?  Are you finding a way to make that adjustment?  What are your thoughts about finding some new hobbies to help boost your mood?  Maybe something related to your studies or completely different to help you relax and de-stress. We can brainstorm some ideas if you'd like!
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there! That's a great question about the mark distribution at RUET.  I understand you're navigating a lot right now, and having a clear understanding of the academic structure can definitely help reduce some stress. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the most up-to-date, precise mark distribution for all RUET programs. The information I found online is a bit scattered and refers to previous years' admission tests ([External Context 1](External Context 1), [External Context 2](External Context 2)).  The best way to get this information would be to directly contact the RUET admissions office or check their official website for the most current academic regulations and marking schemes for your specific program. They'll have the definitive answer.  In the meantime, how are you feeling about tackling the academic side of things?  Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, and reaching out for clarification is a really smart move. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is struggling with adjusting to university life after a difficult admission process. They are experiencing distress, excessive sleep (initially 16 hours, now working towards reduction), and are considering moving to a hostel.  We discussed a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, and some aspects of machine learning (Random Forest).  The user's request for RUET's mark distribution was addressed, with the recommendation to contact the admissions office for accurate details, as readily available information is outdated or incomplete.  We also discussed finding new hobbies to improve mood and managing sleep patterns. The user continues to inquire about the mark distribution, and the same advice is reiterated.

User: Cool
Bot: Great!  So, you're feeling pretty good about the CT cancellation news. That's fantastic! It sounds like you're navigating university life pretty well, even with the tough admission process you went through.  Remember how we talked about feeling distressed and down?  It's great that you are tackling that head-on by considering a change of environment by moving to a hostel.  That could be a really positive step.  And we also spoke about gradually reducing your sleep time from 16 hours to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going?  Are you finding a way to make that adjustment?  What are your thoughts about finding some new hobbies to help boost your mood?  Maybe something related to your studies or completely different to help you relax and de-stress. We can brainstorm some ideas if you'd like!
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there! That's a great question about the mark distribution at RUET.  I understand you're navigating a lot right now, and having a clear understanding of the academic structure can definitely help reduce some stress. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the most up-to-date, precise mark distribution for all RUET programs. The information I found online is a bit scattered and refers to previous years' admission tests ([External Context 1](External Context 1), [External Context 2](External Context 2)).  The best way to get this information would be to directly contact the RUET admissions office or check their official website for the most current academic regulations and marking schemes for your specific program. They'll have the definitive answer.  In the meantime, how are you feeling about tackling the academic side of things?  Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, and reaching out for clarification is a really smart move. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hi again!  I understand you're looking for the mark distribution for RUET.  As I mentioned before, I don't have access to the exact, up-to-the-minute breakdown for all programs. The information available online is either outdated or general ([External Context 1](External Context 1), [External Context 2](External Context 2)). Your best bet is to contact the RUET admissions office directly. They'll have the most accurate and current details for your specific program.  Knowing this information will definitely help reduce some stress!  Is there anything else I can help you with today?  Perhaps we can get back to talking about those hobbies you mentioned ‚Äì finding something new could really make a difference in how you're feeling overall.  And remember, we're still working on gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier range. How is that going?

The user, a newly admitted RUET student struggling with the transition after a difficult admission process, repeatedly asks for the RUET mark distribution.  I've repeatedly advised them to contact the admissions office directly for the most accurate information, as online resources are outdated or incomplete. We've also discussed their distress, excessive sleep (gradually reducing from 16 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, aspects of machine learning (Random Forest), and the need to find new hobbies to improve their mood.  The user is considering moving to a hostel from home.  I've consistently emphasized the importance of contacting the admissions office for the mark distribution and suggested various strategies for stress management and improved well-being.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there! That's a great question about the mark distribution at RUET.  I understand you're navigating a lot right now, and having a clear understanding of the academic structure can definitely help reduce some stress. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the most up-to-date, precise mark distribution for all RUET programs. The information I found online is a bit scattered and refers to previous years' admission tests ([External Context 1](External Context 1), [External Context 2](External Context 2)).  The best way to get this information would be to directly contact the RUET admissions office or check their official website for the most current academic regulations and marking schemes for your specific program. They'll have the definitive answer.  In the meantime, how are you feeling about tackling the academic side of things?  Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, and reaching out for clarification is a really smart move. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hi again!  I understand you're looking for the mark distribution for RUET.  As I mentioned before, I don't have access to the exact, up-to-the-minute breakdown for all programs. The information available online is either outdated or general ([External Context 1](External Context 1), [External Context 2](External Context 2)). Your best bet is to contact the RUET admissions office directly. They'll have the most accurate and current details for your specific program.  Knowing this information will definitely help reduce some stress!  Is there anything else I can help you with today?  Perhaps we can get back to talking about those hobbies you mentioned ‚Äì finding something new could really make a difference in how you're feeling overall.  And remember, we're still working on gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier range. How is that going?
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hi again! I understand you're still looking for the RUET mark distribution.  I really want to help you get this information, but unfortunately, I can't directly access real-time, specific data for all RUET programs.  The information online is either outdated or general, and I don't want to give you incorrect details.  I've said it before, but the best source for the exact, current mark distribution for your program is the RUET admissions office itself.  They're the official source, and reaching out to them directly will give you the precise information you need to feel more confident and less stressed about your studies.  While you're doing that, how about we revisit those hobby ideas? Finding something enjoyable might help take your mind off the mark distribution question for a little while and boost your mood overall. Remember, we're still working towards a healthier sleep schedule too. How's the gradual reduction going?

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is persistently asking for the RUET mark distribution. I've consistently advised them to contact the admissions office directly for the most accurate information, as online and my access to the data is limited.  We've discussed their distress, excessive sleep (gradually reducing from 16 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, aspects of machine learning, and the need to find new hobbies. The user is considering moving to a hostel.  I've emphasized contacting the admissions office and suggested stress-management techniques and well-being strategies.  The user's repeated requests for the mark distribution highlight their anxiety about their academic performance and the challenging admission process. The conversation continues to focus on providing emotional support and guidance while redirecting the user to the appropriate official source for academic information.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hi again!  I understand you're looking for the mark distribution for RUET.  As I mentioned before, I don't have access to the exact, up-to-the-minute breakdown for all programs. The information available online is either outdated or general ([External Context 1](External Context 1), [External Context 2](External Context 2)). Your best bet is to contact the RUET admissions office directly. They'll have the most accurate and current details for your specific program.  Knowing this information will definitely help reduce some stress!  Is there anything else I can help you with today?  Perhaps we can get back to talking about those hobbies you mentioned ‚Äì finding something new could really make a difference in how you're feeling overall.  And remember, we're still working on gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier range. How is that going?
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hi again! I understand you're still looking for the RUET mark distribution.  I really want to help you get this information, but unfortunately, I can't directly access real-time, specific data for all RUET programs.  The information online is either outdated or general, and I don't want to give you incorrect details.  I've said it before, but the best source for the exact, current mark distribution for your program is the RUET admissions office itself.  They're the official source, and reaching out to them directly will give you the precise information you need to feel more confident and less stressed about your studies.  While you're doing that, how about we revisit those hobby ideas? Finding something enjoyable might help take your mind off the mark distribution question for a little while and boost your mood overall. Remember, we're still working towards a healthier sleep schedule too. How's the gradual reduction going?
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you're still searching for the RUET mark distribution.  I wish I could give you the exact numbers, but I just don't have access to that real-time data for all programs.  As I've mentioned several times now, the RUET admissions office is your best bet for the most accurate and current information.  They're the official source, and contacting them directly will give you the peace of mind you need.  It sounds like you're already juggling a lot, so getting this information directly from them will really help reduce some of that stress.  While you're waiting to hear back from them, how about we finally talk about those hobbies?  Remember how we were discussing ways to improve your mood? Finding something enjoyable could be a great distraction and a really positive step towards feeling better.  And please remember to keep working on gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier range ‚Äì how's that going? Let‚Äôs focus on making progress on those things too!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

The information online is either outdated or general, and I don't want to give you incorrect details.  I've said it before, but the best source for the exact, current mark distribution for your program is the RUET admissions office itself.  They're the official source, and reaching out to them directly will give you the precise information you need to feel more confident and less stressed about your studies.  While you're doing that, how about we revisit those hobby ideas? Finding something enjoyable might help take your mind off the mark distribution question for a little while and boost your mood overall. Remember, we're still working towards a healthier sleep schedule too. How's the gradual reduction going?

Bot: Hey there!  I understand you're still searching for the RUET mark distribution.  I wish I could give you the exact numbers, but I just don't have access to that real-time data for all programs.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I hear you again asking about the RUET mark distribution. I completely understand why you're so focused on this ‚Äì it's natural to feel anxious after such a tough admission process.  But, as we've discussed, I simply don't have access to the real-time, specific mark distribution for all RUET programs.  The best and most reliable source for that information is the RUET admissions office itself. They're the official authority, and contacting them directly will give you the accurate, up-to-date details you need.  Getting this information directly from them will remove a lot of that anxiety.  In the meantime, let's shift our focus to something else that could really help. Remember those hobby ideas we talked about?  Finding something you enjoy can be a fantastic way to de-stress and improve your mood.  We also talked about gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going? And have you given any more thought to moving into a hostel?  Let's chat about one of these topics ‚Äì whichever you feel most comfortable discussing right now.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is experiencing significant distress and excessive sleep after a difficult admission process.  They repeatedly request the RUET mark distribution, which I've repeatedly advised them to obtain directly from the RUET admissions office due to my lack of access to real-time data.  We've discussed stress management techniques, healthy sleep habits (gradually reducing sleep from 16 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, potential hobbies to improve their mood, and the possibility of moving to a hostel. The user's persistent focus on the mark distribution highlights their anxiety about academic performance.  The conversation consistently prioritizes emotional support and guidance while directing the user to the appropriate official source for academic information.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you're still searching for the RUET mark distribution.  I wish I could give you the exact numbers, but I just don't have access to that real-time data for all programs.  As I've mentioned several times now, the RUET admissions office is your best bet for the most accurate and current information.  They're the official source, and contacting them directly will give you the peace of mind you need.  It sounds like you're already juggling a lot, so getting this information directly from them will really help reduce some of that stress.  While you're waiting to hear back from them, how about we finally talk about those hobbies?  Remember how we were discussing ways to improve your mood? Finding something enjoyable could be a great distraction and a really positive step towards feeling better.  And please remember to keep working on gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier range ‚Äì how's that going? Let‚Äôs focus on making progress on those things too!
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I hear you again asking about the RUET mark distribution. I completely understand why you're so focused on this ‚Äì it's natural to feel anxious after such a tough admission process.  But, as we've discussed, I simply don't have access to the real-time, specific mark distribution for all RUET programs.  The best and most reliable source for that information is the RUET admissions office itself. They're the official authority, and contacting them directly will give you the accurate, up-to-date details you need.  Getting this information directly from them will remove a lot of that anxiety.  In the meantime, let's shift our focus to something else that could really help. Remember those hobby ideas we talked about?  Finding something you enjoy can be a fantastic way to de-stress and improve your mood.  We also talked about gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going? And have you given any more thought to moving into a hostel?  Let's chat about one of these topics ‚Äì whichever you feel most comfortable discussing right now.
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there! I understand your persistence in asking about the RUET mark distribution. It's completely understandable to want that information, especially after such a challenging admission process.  However, I still don't have access to that specific, real-time data for all RUET programs.  The RUET admissions office remains the only reliable source for the most accurate and updated information.  They are the official source, and contacting them directly will give you the peace of mind you need.  Let's put this aside for now and focus on something else. Remember, we were talking about finding some hobbies to help boost your mood?  And how's that gradual sleep reduction coming along?  Are you still considering the move to a hostel?  Let's talk about any of these ‚Äì whatever feels most comfortable for you right now.

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is experiencing significant distress and excessive sleep after a difficult admission process. They persistently request the RUET mark distribution, which I've repeatedly advised them to obtain directly from the RUET admissions office due to my lack of access to real-time data. We've discussed stress management techniques, healthy sleep habits (gradually reducing sleep from 16 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, potential hobbies to improve their mood, and the possibility of moving to a hostel. The user's persistent focus on the mark distribution highlights their anxiety about academic performance. The conversation consistently prioritizes emotional support and guidance while directing the user to the appropriate official source for academic information.  The user continues to focus on obtaining the mark distribution despite repeated explanations of my inability to provide it.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I hear you again asking about the RUET mark distribution. I completely understand why you're so focused on this ‚Äì it's natural to feel anxious after such a tough admission process.  But, as we've discussed, I simply don't have access to the real-time, specific mark distribution for all RUET programs.  The best and most reliable source for that information is the RUET admissions office itself. They're the official authority, and contacting them directly will give you the accurate, up-to-date details you need.  Getting this information directly from them will remove a lot of that anxiety.  In the meantime, let's shift our focus to something else that could really help. Remember those hobby ideas we talked about?  Finding something you enjoy can be a fantastic way to de-stress and improve your mood.  We also talked about gradually reducing your sleep to a healthier 7-9 hours. How's that going? And have you given any more thought to moving into a hostel?  Let's chat about one of these topics ‚Äì whichever you feel most comfortable discussing right now.

They are the official source, and contacting them directly will give you the peace of mind you need.  Let's put this aside for now and focus on something else. Remember, we were talking about finding some hobbies to help boost your mood?  And how's that gradual sleep reduction coming along?  Are you still considering the move to a hostel?  Let's talk about any of these ‚Äì whatever feels most comfortable for you right now.

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front.

Previous Summary: The user, a newly admitted RUET student struggling with distress and excessive sleep after a difficult admission process, repeatedly requests mark distributions for both RUET and now BUET. I've consistently explained my inability to provide this data, directing them to the respective admissions offices.  We've discussed stress management, sleep hygiene (gradually reducing sleep), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, potential hobbies, and moving to a hostel.  The user's persistent focus on mark distributions highlights their anxiety about academic performance.  The conversation prioritizes emotional support and guidance while directing the user towards official sources for academic information.

The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there! I understand your persistence in asking about the RUET mark distribution. It's completely understandable to want that information, especially after such a challenging admission process.  However, I still don't have access to that specific, real-time data for all RUET programs.  The RUET admissions office remains the only reliable source for the most accurate and updated information.  They are the official source, and contacting them directly will give you the peace of mind you need.  Let's put this aside for now and focus on something else. Remember, we were talking about finding some hobbies to help boost your mood?  And how's that gradual sleep reduction coming along?  Are you still considering the move to a hostel?  Let's talk about any of these ‚Äì whatever feels most comfortable for you right now.
User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you're really keen to know the RUET mark distribution. It's completely understandable to want that information, especially given how tough the admission process was. But I still don't have access to that real-time data.  The RUET admissions office is the only place that can provide you with the exact, up-to-date information.  They're the official source, and contacting them directly is the best way to get the accurate details and ease your anxiety.  Let's focus on something else for a bit. How's that gradual sleep reduction coming along?  Are you finding any time to explore those hobby ideas we talked about?  And have you thought any more about moving into a hostel?  Let's chat about one of those ‚Äì whichever you're feeling ready to discuss.
Bot: Hey there!  It's great you're thinking about other universities too.  Exploring BUET is a smart move!  While I can't provide specific mark distributions for BUET (just like I can't for RUET), I can tell you that it's known for being incredibly competitive, much like RUET.  Many students find the admission process challenging, so your feelings about RUET's admission process are totally valid and shared by many BUET applicants as well.  The good news is that you've already overcome a huge hurdle by getting into RUET ‚Äì that shows incredible resilience and dedication. Remember, your success in getting into RUET shows you have the capabilities to succeed anywhere.  Focusing on your well-being and finding enjoyable hobbies are still important.  How's the sleep reduction coming along?  And what about those hobbies ‚Äì have you had a chance to try anything new?  We also talked about moving to a hostel ‚Äì any progress there?

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is experiencing significant distress and excessive sleep following a difficult admission process. They repeatedly request mark distributions for both RUET and BUET, which I've consistently explained I cannot provide. I've directed them to the respective admissions offices for accurate information. Our conversation has covered stress management, sleep hygiene (gradually reducing sleep from 16 to 7-9 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, potential hobbies to improve mood, and the possibility of moving to a hostel. The user's persistent focus on mark distributions reveals underlying anxiety about academic performance. The conversation prioritizes emotional support and guidance while directing the user towards official sources for academic information.  The user's interest in BUET's mark distribution continues the pattern of seeking numerical data to alleviate anxiety, rather than focusing on well-being strategies.

User: what is the mark distribution at RUET?
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you're really keen to know the RUET mark distribution. It's completely understandable to want that information, especially given how tough the admission process was. But I still don't have access to that real-time data.  The RUET admissions office is the only place that can provide you with the exact, up-to-date information.  They're the official source, and contacting them directly is the best way to get the accurate details and ease your anxiety.  Let's focus on something else for a bit. How's that gradual sleep reduction coming along?  Are you finding any time to explore those hobby ideas we talked about?  And have you thought any more about moving into a hostel?  Let's chat about one of those ‚Äì whichever you're feeling ready to discuss.
Bot: Hey there!  It's great you're thinking about other universities too.  Exploring BUET is a smart move!  While I can't provide specific mark distributions for BUET (just like I can't for RUET), I can tell you that it's known for being incredibly competitive, much like RUET.  Many students find the admission process challenging, so your feelings about RUET's admission process are totally valid and shared by many BUET applicants as well.  The good news is that you've already overcome a huge hurdle by getting into RUET ‚Äì that shows incredible resilience and dedication. Remember, your success in getting into RUET shows you have the capabilities to succeed anywhere.  Focusing on your well-being and finding enjoyable hobbies are still important.  How's the sleep reduction coming along?  And what about those hobbies ‚Äì have you had a chance to try anything new?  We also talked about moving to a hostel ‚Äì any progress there?
User: what about BUET?

Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009.

He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920.

Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe.

The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian.

The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is experiencing significant distress and excessive sleep after a difficult admission process. They repeatedly request mark distributions for RUET, BUET, and now KUET, which I've consistently explained I cannot provide. I've directed them to the respective admissions offices for accurate information.  Our conversation has covered stress management, sleep hygiene (gradually reducing sleep from 16 to 7-9 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, potential hobbies to improve mood, and the possibility of moving to a hostel. The user's persistent focus on mark distributions reveals underlying anxiety about academic performance. The conversation prioritizes emotional support and guidance while directing the user towards official sources for academic information.  The user's interest in various universities' mark distributions continues the pattern of seeking numerical data to alleviate anxiety, rather than focusing on well-being strategies.  I continue to emphasize the importance of focusing on their well-being and exploring hobbies while providing support and encouragement.

Bot: Hey there!  It's great you're thinking about other universities too.  Exploring BUET is a smart move!  While I can't provide specific mark distributions for BUET (just like I can't for RUET), I can tell you that it's known for being incredibly competitive, much like RUET.  Many students find the admission process challenging, so your feelings about RUET's admission process are totally valid and shared by many BUET applicants as well.  The good news is that you've already overcome a huge hurdle by getting into RUET ‚Äì that shows incredible resilience and dedication. Remember, your success in getting into RUET shows you have the capabilities to succeed anywhere.  Focusing on your well-being and finding enjoyable hobbies are still important.  How's the sleep reduction coming along?  And what about those hobbies ‚Äì have you had a chance to try anything new?  We also talked about moving to a hostel ‚Äì any progress there?
User: what about BUET?
User: what about BUET?
Bot: Hey there! I understand your interest in BUET.  It's great that you're exploring your options!  Just like with RUET, I don't have access to the specific BUET mark distributions.  The best place to find that information is directly from the BUET admissions office ‚Äì they're the official source and have the most up-to-date details.  Focusing on that information right now might add to your anxiety, so let's shift our focus for a bit.  How is the gradual sleep reduction going? Are you feeling any better with that?  Have you had a chance to explore those hobbies we talked about?  And what about the possibility of moving to a hostel? Let's talk about what feels most comfortable to you right now.
User: what about KUET?
Bot: Hey there!  It's great that you're exploring different universities ‚Äì KUET is another excellent option! Just like with RUET and BUET, I don't have access to the specific KUET mark distributions.  The best resource for that kind of information would be the KUET admissions office itself. They're the official source and will have the most accurate and up-to-date details.  I know you're feeling anxious, and it's natural to want this information, but focusing on it right now might increase that anxiety. Let's shift gears for a moment. How's the sleep reduction going? Any progress?  Have you tried any of those hobbies we talked about?  And how are you feeling about the possibility of moving to a hostel?

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is experiencing significant distress and excessive sleep after a difficult admission process. They repeatedly request mark distributions for RUET, BUET, and KUET, which I've consistently explained I cannot provide. I've directed them to the respective admissions offices for accurate information. Our conversation has covered stress management, sleep hygiene (gradually reducing sleep from 16 to 7-9 hours), a cancelled architecture CT, a missed deadline for the bdapps Innovation Summit, potential hobbies to improve mood, and the possibility of moving to a hostel. The user's persistent focus on mark distributions reveals underlying anxiety about academic performance. The conversation prioritizes emotional support and guidance while directing the user towards official sources for academic information.  The user's interest in various universities' mark distributions continues the pattern of seeking numerical data to alleviate anxiety, rather than focusing on well-being strategies. I continue to emphasize the importance of focusing on their well-being and exploring hobbies while providing support and encouragement.

User: what about BUET?
Bot: Hey there! I understand your interest in BUET.  It's great that you're exploring your options!  Just like with RUET, I don't have access to the specific BUET mark distributions.  The best place to find that information is directly from the BUET admissions office ‚Äì they're the official source and have the most up-to-date details.  Focusing on that information right now might add to your anxiety, so let's shift our focus for a bit.  How is the gradual sleep reduction going? Are you feeling any better with that?  Have you had a chance to explore those hobbies we talked about?  And what about the possibility of moving to a hostel? Let's talk about what feels most comfortable to you right now.
User: what about KUET?
Bot: Hey there!  It's great that you're exploring different universities ‚Äì KUET is another excellent option! Just like with RUET and BUET, I don't have access to the specific KUET mark distributions.  The best resource for that kind of information would be the KUET admissions office itself. They're the official source and will have the most accurate and up-to-date details.  I know you're feeling anxious, and it's natural to want this information, but focusing on it right now might increase that anxiety. Let's shift gears for a moment. How's the sleep reduction going? Any progress?  Have you tried any of those hobbies we talked about?  And how are you feeling about the possibility of moving to a hostel?  We can talk about whichever of these feels most comfortable for you right now. Remember, your well-being is incredibly important, and we can work through this together.

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Do you know about Dhaka University's hackathon Code Ninja? This year, when it is happening?
Bot: Hey there!  That's a great question about Code Ninja! Unfortunately, I don't have access to the exact dates for Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon this year.  My information is primarily focused on RUET and I haven't been updated on specific events at other universities.  

The best way to find that information would be to check the official Dhaka University website, their computer science department's page, or look for announcements on their social media channels (Facebook, etc.). You could also try searching online for "DU Code Ninja" to see if any past event pages or news articles mention this year's dates.  

Remember, finding out about this hackathon could be a really positive step. It sounds like a fun way to challenge yourself and connect with other students who are passionate about coding ‚Äì something that might help you feel better about things overall.  Even just researching it might help shift your focus to something constructive.  Let me know if you need help with anything else!

Unfortunately, my access to information about events outside of RUET is limited.  The internal posts I can access ([ /posts/58/ ]), ([ /posts/59/ ]), ([ /posts/55/ ]), ([ /posts/60/ ]), and ([ /posts/57/ ]) mostly cover internal university happenings or discussions among students, and don't list broader events.  There was mention of a Teachers Training Program at RUET recently ([ /posts/58/ ]), but nothing else that sounds like a public event.  

To find out about events happening in the wider Dhaka area, I'd suggest checking online event listing sites, local news websites, or the social media pages of organizations or universities you're interested in.  Sometimes just browsing Facebook events for Dhaka can turn up some cool things! 

Remember, even exploring these event listings can be a great way to lift your spirits and get you out of the house.  It's a small step, but it might help you feel a bit more connected and less isolated.  And remember, if you're feeling consistently down, even after trying out some new things, reaching out for professional support is always a good option. We can talk more about that if you'd like.

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student, is struggling with feelings of distress and failure after a tough admission process. They are sleeping excessively (16 hours) and considering moving to a hostel. They are seeking strategies to improve their mood and are exploring hobbies and events. They initially inquired about Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon, for which I couldn't provide specific dates, suggesting they check DU's official resources.  Following this, they asked about other events in general, and I suggested checking online event listings and local resources since my access is limited to RUET-related information.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:

User: Do you know about Dhaka University's hackathon Code Ninja? This year, when it is happening?
Bot: Hey there!  That's a great question about Code Ninja! Unfortunately, I don't have access to the exact dates for Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon this year.  My information is primarily focused on RUET and I haven't been updated on specific events at other universities.  

The best way to find that information would be to check the official Dhaka University website, their computer science department's page, or look for announcements on their social media channels (Facebook, etc.). You could also try searching online for "DU Code Ninja" to see if any past event pages or news articles mention this year's dates.  

Remember, finding out about this hackathon could be a really positive step. It sounds like a fun way to challenge yourself and connect with other students who are passionate about coding ‚Äì something that might help you feel better about things overall.  Even just researching it might help shift your focus to something constructive.  Let me know if you need help with anything else!
User: Ahh so is there any more events happening there lately?
Bot: Hey there!  So you're wondering about other events happening around RUET or in general?  Unfortunately, my access to information about events outside of RUET is limited.  The internal posts I can access ([ /posts/58/ ]), ([ /posts/59/ ]), ([ /posts/55/ ]), ([ /posts/60/ ]), and ([ /posts/57/ ]) mostly cover internal university happenings or discussions among students, and don't list broader events.  There was mention of a Teachers Training Program at RUET recently ([ /posts/58/ ]), but nothing else that sounds like a public event.  

To find out about events happening in the wider Dhaka area, I'd suggest checking online event listing sites, local news websites, or the social media pages of organizations or universities you're interested in.  Sometimes just browsing Facebook events for Dhaka can turn up some cool things! 

Remember, even exploring these event listings can be a great way to lift your spirits and get you out of the house.

Previous Summary: The user, a new RUET student, is struggling with feelings of distress and failure after a difficult admission process. They are sleeping excessively (16 hours) and are considering moving to a hostel. They're looking for ways to improve their mood and are exploring hobbies and events.  They initially inquired about Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon, for which I couldn't provide specific dates, suggesting they check DU's resources. They then asked about other events, and I suggested checking online event listings and local resources due to my limited access to information outside RUET.  In their latest message, they asked me to search the web for events, which I couldn't do due to my limitations, but I advised them to use online search engines instead. We also discussed the importance of seeking professional help if their low mood persists.

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a new RUET student, is struggling with feelings of distress and failure after a difficult admission process. They are sleeping excessively (16 hours) and are considering moving to a hostel. They're looking for ways to improve their mood and are exploring hobbies and events.  They initially inquired about Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon, for which I couldn't provide specific dates, suggesting they check DU's resources. They then asked about other events, and I suggested checking online event listings and local resources due to my limited access to information outside RUET.  In their latest message, they asked me to search the web for events, which I couldn't do due to my limitations, but I advised them to use online search engines instead. We also discussed the importance of seeking professional help if their low mood persists.

User: Do you know about Dhaka University's hackathon Code Ninja? This year, when it is happening?
Bot: Hey there!  That's a great question about Code Ninja! Unfortunately, I don't have access to the exact dates for Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon this year.  My information is primarily focused on RUET and I haven't been updated on specific events at other universities.  

The best way to find that information would be to check the official Dhaka University website, their computer science department's page, or look for announcements on their social media channels (Facebook, etc.). You could also try searching online for "DU Code Ninja" to see if any past event pages or news articles mention this year's dates.  

Remember, finding out about this hackathon could be a really positive step. It sounds like a fun way to challenge yourself and connect with other students who are passionate about coding ‚Äì something that might help you feel better about things overall.  Even just researching it might help shift your focus to something constructive.  Let me know if you need help with anything else!
User: Ahh so is there any more events happening there lately?
Bot: Hey there!  So you're wondering about other events happening around RUET or in general?  Unfortunately, my access to information about events outside of RUET is limited.  The internal posts I can access ([ /posts/58/ ]), ([ /posts/59/ ]), ([ /posts/55/ ]), ([ /posts/60/ ]), and ([ /posts/57/ ]) mostly cover internal university happenings or discussions among students, and don't list broader events.  There was mention of a Teachers Training Program at RUET recently ([ /posts/58/ ]), but nothing else that sounds like a public event.  

To find out about events happening in the wider Dhaka area, I'd suggest checking online event listing sites, local news websites, or the social media pages of organizations or universities you're interested in.  Sometimes just browsing Facebook events for Dhaka can turn up some cool things! 

Remember, even exploring these event listings can be a great way to lift your spirits and get you out of the house.  It's a small step, but it might help you feel a bit more connected and less isolated.  And remember, if you're feeling consistently down, even after trying out some new things, reaching out for professional support is always a good option. We can talk more about that if you'd like.
User: Please search the web about it
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you'd like me to search the web for events.  Unfortunately, my access to real-time web searches is limited.  I'm primarily designed to access and process information from RUET's internal systems and pre-loaded datasets.  That's why I couldn't give you specific dates for the Code Ninja hackathon or a list of other events. 

To find events, I strongly recommend using online search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.  You can search for things like "events in Dhaka," "Dhaka university events," or even more specific terms depending on what you're interested in (e.g., "coding events Dhaka," "art exhibitions Dhaka").  Many websites and social media pages also list events ‚Äì Facebook events is a good place to start!

Remember, exploring events and activities can be a really helpful way to boost your mood and connect with others.  It might take some effort to find something that suits you, but it's worth it to try.  And remember, if you continue to feel down, please reach out for professional help.  We can discuss ways to access support services if you'd like. Let me know how it goes!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The user, a newly admitted RUET student struggling with distress and feelings of failure after a difficult admission process, is actively seeking ways to improve their mood and explore new hobbies and social activities.  They initially inquired about Dhaka University's Code Ninja hackathon, but I couldn't provide specific dates, advising them to check DU's resources.  They then asked about other events, and I suggested checking online event listings and local resources due to my limited access to information outside RUET.  They then asked me to search the web, which I couldn't do but advised them to use online search engines.  Their excessive sleep (16 hours) was discussed, and we're working on gradually reducing it. They're considering moving to a hostel.  The user also asked about events at BUET, and I advised them to check BUET's website and online resources.

Recent chat history for this specific conversation:
---
User: Ahh so is there any more events happening there lately?
Bot: Hey there!  So you're wondering about other events happening around RUET or in general?  Unfortunately, my access to information about events outside of RUET is limited.  The internal posts I can access ([ /posts/58/ ]), ([ /posts/59/ ]), ([ /posts/55/ ]), ([ /posts/60/ ]), and ([ /posts/57/ ]) mostly cover internal university happenings or discussions among students, and don't list broader events.  There was mention of a Teachers Training Program at RUET recently ([ /posts/58/ ]), but nothing else that sounds like a public event.  

To find out about events happening in the wider Dhaka area, I'd suggest checking online event listing sites, local news websites, or the social media pages of organizations or universities you're interested in.  Sometimes just browsing Facebook events for Dhaka can turn up some cool things! 

Remember, even exploring these event listings can be a great way to lift your spirits and get you out of the house.  It's a small step, but it might help you feel a bit more connected and less isolated.  And remember, if you're feeling consistently down, even after trying out some new things, reaching out for professional support is always a good option. We can talk more about that if you'd like.
User: Please search the web about it
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you'd like me to search the web for events.  Unfortunately, my access to real-time web searches is limited.  I'm primarily designed to access and process information from RUET's internal systems and pre-loaded datasets.  That's why I couldn't give you specific dates for the Code Ninja hackathon or a list of other events. 

To find events, I strongly recommend using online search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.  You can search for things like "events in Dhaka," "Dhaka university events," or even more specific terms depending on what you're interested in (e.g., "coding events Dhaka," "art exhibitions Dhaka").  Many websites and social media pages also list events ‚Äì Facebook events is a good place to start!

Remember, exploring events and activities can be a really helpful way to boost your mood and connect with others.  It might take some effort to find something that suits you, but it's worth it to try.  And remember, if you continue to feel down, please reach out for professional help.  We can discuss ways to access support services if you'd like. Let me know how it goes!
User: Cool is somehting happeing in BUET lately?
Bot: Hey there!  So you're curious about what's happening at BUET lately? That's great!  Unfortunately, like with events at other universities, my access to real-time information about BUET is limited. I mainly focus on RUET's internal systems. 

To find out about events at BUET, the best approach would be to check BUET's official website directly.  You can usually find an events calendar, news section, or announcements on their social media pages.  Searching online for "BUET events" or "BUET [specific area of interest, e.g., 'computer science events']" will likely turn up some useful results too.

Remember, exploring different places and activities is a fantastic way to improve your mood. It's all about finding something that sparks your interest and makes you feel good.  And if you're still feeling down, please don't hesitate to reach out for professional help ‚Äì we can explore that together if you'd like. Let me know what you find!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Please search the web about it
Bot: Hey there!  I understand you'd like me to search the web for events.  Unfortunately, my access to real-time web searches is limited.  I'm primarily designed to access and process information from RUET's internal systems and pre-loaded datasets.  That's why I couldn't give you specific dates for the Code Ninja hackathon or a list of other events. 

To find events, I strongly recommend using online search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.  You can search for things like "events in Dhaka," "Dhaka university events," or even more specific terms depending on what you're interested in (e.g., "coding events Dhaka," "art exhibitions Dhaka").  Many websites and social media pages also list events ‚Äì Facebook events is a good place to start!

Remember, exploring events and activities can be a really helpful way to boost your mood and connect with others.  It might take some effort to find something that suits you, but it's worth it to try.  And remember, if you continue to feel down, please reach out for professional help.  We can discuss ways to access support services if you'd like. Let me know how it goes!
User: Cool is somehting happeing in BUET lately?
Bot: Hey there!  So you're curious about what's happening at BUET lately? That's great!  Unfortunately, like with events at other universities, my access to real-time information about BUET is limited. I mainly focus on RUET's internal systems. 

To find out about events at BUET, the best approach would be to check BUET's official website directly.  You can usually find an events calendar, news section, or announcements on their social media pages.  Searching online for "BUET events" or "BUET [specific area of interest, e.g., 'computer science events']" will likely turn up some useful results too.

Remember, exploring different places and activities is a fantastic way to improve your mood. It's all about finding something that sparks your interest and makes you feel good.  And if you're still feeling down, please don't hesitate to reach out for professional help ‚Äì we can explore that together if you'd like. Let me know what you find!

Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Cool is somehting happeing in BUET lately?
Bot: Hey there!  So you're curious about what's happening at BUET lately? That's great!  Unfortunately, like with events at other universities, my access to real-time information about BUET is limited. I mainly focus on RUET's internal systems. 

To find out about events at BUET, the best approach would be to check BUET's official website directly.  You can usually find an events calendar, news section, or announcements on their social media pages.  Searching online for "BUET events" or "BUET [specific area of interest, e.g., 'computer science events']" will likely turn up some useful results too.

Remember, exploring different places and activities is a fantastic way to improve your mood. It's all about finding something that sparks your interest and makes you feel good.  And if you're still feeling down, please don't hesitate to reach out for professional help ‚Äì we can explore that together if you'd like. Let me know what you find!
User: Do you know something about the StartUp Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program?
Bot: Hey there!  That's a great question about the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program!  I don't have access to the most up-to-date, detailed information on specific programs like that. My knowledge is primarily focused on internal RUET announcements and discussions.  However, based on my searches, I found some relevant information online. 

It seems there's been activity around startup incubation in Rajshahi, possibly linked to RUET, though specifics are limited in my access. I found mentions of a 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' program on Facebook ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)) and also a University Innovation Hub Program at RUET ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)), which might be related.  The information I found is a bit scattered, so I strongly suggest checking the official RUET website and searching online for 'RUET incubation program' or 'Startup Rajshahi RUET' for the most current and complete details.  This will give you the most accurate and up-to-date information.  Let me know if you have any other questions!
User: Do you know something about the StartUp Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program?
Bot: Hey there!  It's great you're looking into the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program!  That shows initiative and ambition, which is fantastic.  As I mentioned before, I don't have direct access to the most up-to-date details on specific programs like this.  My knowledge base is mostly internal RUET information.  However, I did find some links online suggesting there might be connections between Startup Rajshahi and initiatives at RUET, including a possible University Innovation Hub Program ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)).  I also found a mention of 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)).  But remember, these are just snippets I found online. For the most reliable info, I really recommend checking the official RUET website and searching online using terms like 'RUET incubation program' or 'Startup Rajshahi RUET'.  This will give you the most accurate and current details.  Let me know if you find anything interesting or if you have any more questions!  Remember, exploring these opportunities is a great way to boost your mood and build your future!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe.

The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere.

User: Do you know something about the StartUp Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program?
Bot: Hey there!  That's a great question about the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program!  I don't have access to the most up-to-date, detailed information on specific programs like that. My knowledge is primarily focused on internal RUET announcements and discussions.  However, based on my searches, I found some relevant information online. 

It seems there's been activity around startup incubation in Rajshahi, possibly linked to RUET, though specifics are limited in my access. I found mentions of a 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' program on Facebook ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)) and also a University Innovation Hub Program at RUET ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)), which might be related.  The information I found is a bit scattered, so I strongly suggest checking the official RUET website and searching online for 'RUET incubation program' or 'Startup Rajshahi RUET' for the most current and complete details.  This will give you the most accurate and up-to-date information.  Let me know if you have any other questions!
User: Do you know something about the StartUp Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program?
Bot: Hey there!  It's great you're looking into the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program!  That shows initiative and ambition, which is fantastic.  As I mentioned before, I don't have direct access to the most up-to-date details on specific programs like this.  My knowledge base is mostly internal RUET information.  However, I did find some links online suggesting there might be connections between Startup Rajshahi and initiatives at RUET, including a possible University Innovation Hub Program ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)).  I also found a mention of 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)).  But remember, these are just snippets I found online. For the most reliable info, I really recommend checking the official RUET website and searching online using terms like 'RUET incubation program' or 'Startup Rajshahi RUET'.  This will give you the most accurate and current details.  Let me know if you find anything interesting or if you have any more questions!  Remember, exploring these opportunities is a great way to boost your mood and build your future!
Bot: Hey there!  You're showing fantastic initiative by exploring the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program! That's a really smart move.  As I've mentioned before, I don't have direct access to the most detailed, up-to-the-minute information on specific external programs like this. My knowledge base is mainly focused on internal RUET matters.  However, I've done some searching, and while I haven't found a definitive, combined "Startup Rajshahi and RUET Incubation Program," I have found some related initiatives that might be of interest.  I previously mentioned the possible connection with a University Innovation Hub at RUET ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)) and a separate 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' program ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)).  To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, your best bet is to check the official RUET website for details on any incubation programs they might offer, and also search online using specific keywords like 'RUET incubation program,' 'Startup Rajshahi RUET,' or similar.  I really encourage you to do this.  It's a great way to learn more, and the process of researching will itself be a productive activity that can help lift your spirits.  Let me know what you find!

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Do you know something about the StartUp Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program?
Bot: Hey there!  It's great you're looking into the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program!  That shows initiative and ambition, which is fantastic.  As I mentioned before, I don't have direct access to the most up-to-date details on specific programs like this.  My knowledge base is mostly internal RUET information.  However, I did find some links online suggesting there might be connections between Startup Rajshahi and initiatives at RUET, including a possible University Innovation Hub Program ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)).  I also found a mention of 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)).  But remember, these are just snippets I found online. For the most reliable info, I really recommend checking the official RUET website and searching online using terms like 'RUET incubation program' or 'Startup Rajshahi RUET'.  This will give you the most accurate and current details.  Let me know if you find anything interesting or if you have any more questions!  Remember, exploring these opportunities is a great way to boost your mood and build your future!
Bot: Hey there!  You're showing fantastic initiative by exploring the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program! That's a really smart move.  As I've mentioned before, I don't have direct access to the most detailed, up-to-the-minute information on specific external programs like this. My knowledge base is mainly focused on internal RUET matters.  However, I've done some searching, and while I haven't found a definitive, combined "Startup Rajshahi and RUET Incubation Program," I have found some related initiatives that might be of interest.  I previously mentioned the possible connection with a University Innovation Hub at RUET ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)) and a separate 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' program ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)).  To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, your best bet is to check the official RUET website for details on any incubation programs they might offer, and also search online using specific keywords like 'RUET incubation program,' 'Startup Rajshahi RUET,' or similar.  I really encourage you to do this.  It's a great way to learn more, and the process of researching will itself be a productive activity that can help lift your spirits.  Let me know what you find!

Search the gist part about it: I'm planning to change our work laptops to PCs (we work with UX, using Photoshop, Adobe XD, and some rare cases even After Effects), also using one of them for VR games and/or both for some casual gaming.We have here two options: build one pc and create two virtual instances of Windows, linked to two keyboard/mouses and monitors, or build two pcs.The first option would be good to have only one PC to update when needed, and the overall cost may be lower because I'd buy one piece of most of the parts (instead of two processors of $200, I could get a better one for $360 with double the cores). For that, I would consider for example something like the Ryzen 5800x with a B550M or a Z motherboard, with 2 GPU TBD to be used in bypass mode on the virtualization, one for each instance.However, considering that DDR5 is around the corner, and most probably in 2-3 years, I'd have to change most of the parts of the PC to have it compatible, the advantage kinda goes away. I also want to consider getting a couple of cheaper motherboard + CPU sets on Aliexpress (they don't have the 5800x for example, so the difference in price would be bigger than local stores). For example, a Ryzen 3600x + B450 for each computer, I can get that with less than $300 each on Aliexpress.What do you think would be better to have?edit: my only concerns are: cost, updates, and performance. I'm not concerned with being without a pc if a hardware fails, as I have others to use while I replace the hardware.

The conversation started with the user expressing distress and feelings of failure after a tough RUET admission process, coupled with excessive sleep.  We discussed strategies for improving their emotional well-being, focusing on gradually reducing sleep, exploring hobbies, and considering professional help.  Their interest in Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program led to searches for relevant information (though no definitive program was found).  They inquired about the BDAPPS Innovation Summit 2025 criteria, which I provided.  Finally, the conversation shifted to a technical question about building one high-end PC with dual virtual instances or two separate PCs for UX work, VR gaming, and casual gaming, considering cost, updates, and performance.  Throughout, I've emphasized seeking professional help for emotional well-being and checking the official RUET website for the most accurate information on university programs.

Bot: Hey there!  You're showing fantastic initiative by exploring the Startup Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program! That's a really smart move.  As I've mentioned before, I don't have direct access to the most detailed, up-to-the-minute information on specific external programs like this. My knowledge base is mainly focused on internal RUET matters.  However, I've done some searching, and while I haven't found a definitive, combined "Startup Rajshahi and RUET Incubation Program," I have found some related initiatives that might be of interest.  I previously mentioned the possible connection with a University Innovation Hub at RUET ([https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464](https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=122199142874119414&id=61553582439464)) and a separate 'Startup Rajshahi Incubation 1.0' program ([https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/](https://www.facebook.com/BAUET.CSE/posts/startup-rajshahi-incubation-10-is-here-application-link-httpsformsgletypckhby4x3/579393963591731/)).  To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, your best bet is to check the official RUET website for details on any incubation programs they might offer, and also search online using specific keywords like 'RUET incubation program,' 'Startup Rajshahi RUET,' or similar.  I really encourage you to do this.  It's a great way to learn more, and the process of researching will itself be a productive activity that can help lift your spirits.  Let me know what you find!
User: Do you know something about the StartUp Rajshahi and RUET University Incubation program?
User: What is criteria of BDAPPS innovation summit 2025?
Bot: Hey there!  The BDAPPS Innovation Summit 2025 sounds exciting!  From what I've found online, the criteria seem to focus on several key areas: Market Potential (35 points), Feasibility & Implementation (30 points), Innovation & Creativity (20 points), and Presentation & Clarity (15 points).  The readiness of your application/digital solution will be prioritized.  [https://bdappsinnovationsummit.com/](https://bdappsinnovationsummit.com/) 

It's great that you're exploring this opportunity!  Remember, even the process of researching and preparing an application can be really rewarding.  Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions as you work on your application. I'm here to support you!
Bot: Hey there!  This is a really thoughtful question about upgrading your work laptops.  Let's break down the pros and cons of each option, keeping cost, updates, and performance in mind. 

**Option 1: One PC with two virtual instances**

* **Pros:** Lower initial cost (especially with a high-end CPU like the Ryzen 5800x), easier updates (just one system to manage), potentially less power consumption.
* **Cons:**  Performance might be a bottleneck, especially with demanding software like Photoshop, After Effects, and VR games. Virtualization can impact performance, and you might experience lag or slowdowns.  Also, if one virtual instance crashes, it could potentially affect the other.  As you mentioned, the rapid pace of technology means that in a few years you'll probably need to replace most components to use newer tech like DDR5. This negates the initial cost savings to a large extent.

**Option 2: Two separate PCs**

* **Pros:**  Better performance ‚Äì each PC can be optimized for its specific tasks (one for heavy UX work, one for gaming/VR).  More stable ‚Äì if one PC fails, the other is still operational. Easier to customize each system to the exact specifications required.
* **Cons:** Higher initial cost (double the components), more management overhead (two systems to update and maintain).

**Considering your concerns:**

Since performance is key for your UX work and gaming, and you're not overly concerned about downtime, **two separate PCs seems like the more robust and future-proof solution in the long run**.  While the initial cost is higher, it avoids the performance limitations of virtualization and allows for independent upgrades as needed.  

**Regarding Aliexpress:**  While you can find cheaper components on Aliexpress, make sure to factor in shipping costs and potential customs duties.  Also, prioritize reputable sellers to avoid counterfeit or defective parts.  It's also wise to compare prices from local stores as well.  The price difference might not be as significant as you think once you factor in these costs.

Let's explore some specific component recommendations based on your budget and needs.  What's your approximate budget for each PC (or the total budget for both)?  Knowing this will help me suggest suitable components.  Also, what's your ideal resolution for your monitors?  This will help in choosing appropriate GPUs.  I can help you find a good balance between cost, performance, and future-proofing.  Let's discuss!
User: Search the gist part about it: I'm planning to change our work laptops to PCs (we work with UX, using Photoshop, Adobe XD, and some rare cases even After Effects), also using one of them for VR games and/or both for some casual gaming.We have here two options: build one pc and create two virtual instances of Windows, linked to two keyboard/mouses and monitors, or build two pcs.The first option would be good to have only one PC to update when needed, and the overall cost may be lower because I'd buy one piece of most of the parts (instead of two processors of $200, I could get a better one for $360 with double the cores). For that, I would consider for example something like the Ryzen 5800x with a B550M or a Z motherboard, with 2 GPU TBD to be used in bypass mode on the virtualization, one for each instance.However, considering that DDR5 is around the corner, and most probably in 2-3 years, I'd have to change most of the parts of the PC to have it compatible, the advantage kinda goes away. I also want to consider getting a couple of cheaper motherboard + CPU sets on Aliexpress (they don't have the 5800x for example, so the difference in price would be bigger than local stores). For example, a Ryzen 3600x + B450 for each computer, I can get that with less than $300 each on Aliexpress.What do you think would be better to have?edit: my only concerns are: cost, updates, and performance. I'm not concerned with being without a pc if a hardware fails, as I have others to use while I replace the hardware.

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them.

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The conversation began with the user expressing significant distress and feelings of failure after a challenging RUET admission process, coupled with excessive sleep (16 hours/day). We discussed strategies to improve their well-being, including gradually reducing sleep to 7-9 hours, exploring hobbies, and considering professional help.  Their interest in Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program led to searches for relevant information (resulting in links to related but separate initiatives).  They inquired about the BDAPPS Innovation Summit 2025 criteria (provided).  The conversation shifted to a technical question regarding building one high-end PC with dual virtual instances or two separate PCs for UX work, VR gaming, and casual gaming, considering cost, updates, and performance. We analyzed the pros and cons of each option, leaning towards two separate PCs for optimal performance. The user's consideration of Aliexpress for cheaper components was also discussed.  Finally, the user asked about the weather in Rajshahi.

User: What is criteria of BDAPPS innovation summit 2025?
Bot: Hey there!  The BDAPPS Innovation Summit 2025 sounds exciting!  From what I've found online, the criteria seem to focus on several key areas: Market Potential (35 points), Feasibility & Implementation (30 points), Innovation & Creativity (20 points), and Presentation & Clarity (15 points).  The readiness of your application/digital solution will be prioritized.  [https://bdappsinnovationsummit.com/](https://bdappsinnovationsummit.com/) 

It's great that you're exploring this opportunity!  Remember, even the process of researching and preparing an application can be really rewarding.  Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions as you work on your application. I'm here to support you!
Bot: Hey there!  This is a really thoughtful question about upgrading your work laptops.  Let's break down the pros and cons of each option, keeping cost, updates, and performance in mind. 

**Option 1: One PC with two virtual instances**

* **Pros:** Lower initial cost (especially with a high-end CPU like the Ryzen 5800x), easier updates (just one system to manage), potentially less power consumption.
* **Cons:**  Performance might be a bottleneck, especially with demanding software like Photoshop, After Effects, and VR games. Virtualization can impact performance, and you might experience lag or slowdowns.  Also, if one virtual instance crashes, it could potentially affect the other.  As you mentioned, the rapid pace of technology means that in a few years you'll probably need to replace most components to use newer tech like DDR5. This negates the initial cost savings to a large extent.

**Option 2: Two separate PCs**

* **Pros:**  Better performance ‚Äì each PC can be optimized for its specific tasks (one for heavy UX work, one for gaming/VR).  More stable ‚Äì if one PC fails, the other is still operational. Easier to customize each system to the exact specifications required.
* **Cons:** Higher initial cost (double the components), more management overhead (two systems to update and maintain).

**Considering your concerns:**

Since performance is key for your UX work and gaming, and you're not overly concerned about downtime, **two separate PCs seems like the more robust and future-proof solution in the long run**.  While the initial cost is higher, it avoids the performance limitations of virtualization and allows for independent upgrades as needed.  

**Regarding Aliexpress:**  While you can find cheaper components on Aliexpress, make sure to factor in shipping costs and potential customs duties.  Also, prioritize reputable sellers to avoid counterfeit or defective parts.  It's also wise to compare prices from local stores as well.  The price difference might not be as significant as you think once you factor in these costs.

Let's explore some specific component recommendations based on your budget and needs.  What's your approximate budget for each PC (or the total budget for both)?  Knowing this will help me suggest suitable components.  Also, what's your ideal resolution for your monitors?  This will help in choosing appropriate GPUs.  I can help you find a good balance between cost, performance, and future-proofing.  Let's discuss!
User: Search the gist part about it: I'm planning to change our work laptops to PCs (we work with UX, using Photoshop, Adobe XD, and some rare cases even After Effects), also using one of them for VR games and/or both for some casual gaming.We have here two options: build one pc and create two virtual instances of Windows, linked to two keyboard/mouses and monitors, or build two pcs.The first option would be good to have only one PC to update when needed, and the overall cost may be lower because I'd buy one piece of most of the parts (instead of two processors of $200, I could get a better one for $360 with double the cores). For that, I would consider for example something like the Ryzen 5800x with a B550M or a Z motherboard, with 2 GPU TBD to be used in bypass mode on the virtualization, one for each instance.However, considering that DDR5 is around the corner, and most probably in 2-3 years, I'd have to change most of the parts of the PC to have it compatible, the advantage kinda goes away. I also want to consider getting a couple of cheaper motherboard + CPU sets on Aliexpress (they don't have the 5800x for example, so the difference in price would be bigger than local stores). For example, a Ryzen 3600x + B450 for each computer, I can get that with less than $300 each on Aliexpress.What do you think would be better to have?edit: my only concerns are: cost, updates, and performance. I'm not concerned with being without a pc if a hardware fails, as I have others to use while I replace the hardware.
User: Weather at Rajshahi
Bot: Hey there!  Checking the weather in Rajshahi is a great idea ‚Äì knowing the conditions can help you plan your day!  I don't have real-time access to weather information, but a quick search online using a weather website or app should give you the most up-to-date forecast.  Let me know if you have any other questions ‚Äì I'm here to help!

Previous conversation summary of this specific conversation:
---
The conversation started with the user expressing significant distress and feelings of failure after a challenging RUET admission process, coupled with excessive sleep (16 hours/day). We discussed strategies to improve their well-being, including gradually reducing sleep to 7-9 hours, exploring hobbies, and considering professional help. Their interest in Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program led to searches for relevant information. They inquired about the BDAPPS Innovation Summit 2025 criteria (provided).  The conversation shifted to a technical question regarding building one high-end PC with dual virtual instances or two separate PCs for UX work, VR gaming, and casual gaming, considering cost, updates, and performance. We analyzed the pros and cons of each option, leaning towards two separate PCs for optimal performance. The user's consideration of Aliexpress for cheaper components was also discussed. The user then asked about the weather in Rajshahi and finally responded with "Coollll", indicating a more positive mood.

Bot: Hey there!  This is a really thoughtful question about upgrading your work laptops.  Let's break down the pros and cons of each option, keeping cost, updates, and performance in mind. 

**Option 1: One PC with two virtual instances**

* **Pros:** Lower initial cost (especially with a high-end CPU like the Ryzen 5800x), easier updates (just one system to manage), potentially less power consumption.
* **Cons:**  Performance might be a bottleneck, especially with demanding software like Photoshop, After Effects, and VR games. Virtualization can impact performance, and you might experience lag or slowdowns.  Also, if one virtual instance crashes, it could potentially affect the other.  As you mentioned, the rapid pace of technology means that in a few years you'll probably need to replace most components to use newer tech like DDR5. This negates the initial cost savings to a large extent.

**Option 2: Two separate PCs**

* **Pros:**  Better performance ‚Äì each PC can be optimized for its specific tasks (one for heavy UX work, one for gaming/VR).  More stable ‚Äì if one PC fails, the other is still operational. Easier to customize each system to the exact specifications required.
* **Cons:** Higher initial cost (double the components), more management overhead (two systems to update and maintain).

**Considering your concerns:**

Since performance is key for your UX work and gaming, and you're not overly concerned about downtime, **two separate PCs seems like the more robust and future-proof solution in the long run**.  While the initial cost is higher, it avoids the performance limitations of virtualization and allows for independent upgrades as needed.  

**Regarding Aliexpress:**  While you can find cheaper components on Aliexpress, make sure to factor in shipping costs and potential customs duties.  Also, prioritize reputable sellers to avoid counterfeit or defective parts.  It's also wise to compare prices from local stores as well.  The price difference might not be as significant as you think once you factor in these costs.

Let's explore some specific component recommendations based on your budget and needs.  What's your approximate budget for each PC (or the total budget for both)?  Knowing this will help me suggest suitable components.  Also, what's your ideal resolution for your monitors?  This will help in choosing appropriate GPUs.  I can help you find a good balance between cost, performance, and future-proofing.  Let's discuss!
User: Search the gist part about it: I'm planning to change our work laptops to PCs (we work with UX, using Photoshop, Adobe XD, and some rare cases even After Effects), also using one of them for VR games and/or both for some casual gaming.We have here two options: build one pc and create two virtual instances of Windows, linked to two keyboard/mouses and monitors, or build two pcs.The first option would be good to have only one PC to update when needed, and the overall cost may be lower because I'd buy one piece of most of the parts (instead of two processors of $200, I could get a better one for $360 with double the cores). For that, I would consider for example something like the Ryzen 5800x with a B550M or a Z motherboard, with 2 GPU TBD to be used in bypass mode on the virtualization, one for each instance.However, considering that DDR5 is around the corner, and most probably in 2-3 years, I'd have to change most of the parts of the PC to have it compatible, the advantage kinda goes away. I also want to consider getting a couple of cheaper motherboard + CPU sets on Aliexpress (they don't have the 5800x for example, so the difference in price would be bigger than local stores). For example, a Ryzen 3600x + B450 for each computer, I can get that with less than $300 each on Aliexpress.What do you think would be better to have?edit: my only concerns are: cost, updates, and performance. I'm not concerned with being without a pc if a hardware fails, as I have others to use while I replace the hardware.
User: Weather at Rajshahi
Bot: Hey there!  Checking the weather in Rajshahi is a great idea ‚Äì knowing the conditions can help you plan your day!  I don't have real-time access to weather information, but a quick search online using a weather website or app should give you the most up-to-date forecast.  Let me know if you have any other questions ‚Äì I'm here to help!
User: Coollll
Bot: Hey there!  "Coollll" ‚Äì I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit more positive!  Is there anything specific you'd like to chat about now? We were discussing your PC build plans, and I'm happy to help you brainstorm component choices or work through any other questions you may have about that. Or perhaps you'd like to talk more about your hobbies, or your plans for applying to Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program?  I'm here to support you in any way I can. Let me know what's on your mind!

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth.

The conversation shifted to planning a high-end PC build for UX work, VR gaming, and casual gaming, considering cost, updates, and performance. We analyzed the pros and cons of building one PC with dual virtual instances versus two separate PCs, leaning towards two separate PCs. The user's consideration of Aliexpress for cheaper components was also discussed.  The user then asked about the weather in Rajshahi and expressed a more positive mood.  Finally, the user shared their disappointment at losing a CHESS hero competition and expressed sadness.

But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature.

Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: Weather at Rajshahi
Bot: Hey there!  Checking the weather in Rajshahi is a great idea ‚Äì knowing the conditions can help you plan your day!  I don't have real-time access to weather information, but a quick search online using a weather website or app should give you the most up-to-date forecast.  Let me know if you have any other questions ‚Äì I'm here to help!
User: Coollll
Bot: Hey there!  "Coollll" ‚Äì I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit more positive!  Is there anything specific you'd like to chat about now? We were discussing your PC build plans, and I'm happy to help you brainstorm component choices or work through any other questions you may have about that. Or perhaps you'd like to talk more about your hobbies, or your plans for applying to Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program?  I'm here to support you in any way I can. Let me know what's on your mind!
User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh no, sweetheart, I'm so sorry to hear you lost the CHESS hero competition and that you're crying.  It's completely normal to feel upset and disappointed after putting in effort and not achieving the outcome you wanted.  Losing is a part of life, and it's okay to feel the emotions that come with it.  It takes a lot of courage to participate in a competition like that, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself for even trying.  

Take some time to process your feelings.  Allow yourself to cry, to feel the sadness, and don't try to bottle it up.  It's important to let these emotions out in a healthy way.  Maybe listen to some calming music, spend time in nature, or talk to a friend or family member about how you're feeling.  

Remember that this one competition doesn't define you or your abilities.  There will be other opportunities in the future, and you can learn from this experience to improve your skills and strategies for the next time.  Focus on what you learned from the competition, what you did well, and what you could improve on for the future.  And most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing great navigating university life and all its challenges.  

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps we can discuss some relaxing hobbies to help you unwind and de-stress, or maybe you'd like to go back to discussing your PC build plans?

We were discussing your PC build plans, and I'm happy to help you brainstorm component choices or work through any other questions you may have about that. Or perhaps you'd like to talk more about your hobbies, or your plans for applying to Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program?  I'm here to support you in any way I can. Let me know what's on your mind!
User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh no, sweetheart, I'm so sorry to hear you lost the CHESS hero competition and that you're crying.  It's completely normal to feel upset and disappointed after putting in effort and not achieving the outcome you wanted.  Losing is a part of life, and it's okay to feel the emotions that come with it.  It takes a lot of courage to participate in a competition like that, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself for even trying.  

Take some time to process your feelings.  Allow yourself to cry, to feel the sadness, and don't try to bottle it up.  It's important to let these emotions out in a healthy way.  Maybe listen to some calming music, spend time in nature, or talk to a friend or family member about how you're feeling.  

Remember that this one competition doesn't define you or your abilities.  There will be other opportunities in the future, and you can learn from this experience to improve your skills and strategies for the next time.  Focus on what you learned from the competition, what you did well, and what you could improve on for the future.  And most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing great navigating university life and all its challenges.  

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps we can discuss some relaxing hobbies to help you unwind and de-stress, or maybe you'd like to go back to discussing your PC build plans?

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

Bot: Hey there!  "Coollll" ‚Äì I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit more positive!  Is there anything specific you'd like to chat about now? We were discussing your PC build plans, and I'm happy to help you brainstorm component choices or work through any other questions you may have about that. Or perhaps you'd like to talk more about your hobbies, or your plans for applying to Startup Rajshahi and the RUET University Incubation program?  I'm here to support you in any way I can. Let me know what's on your mind!
User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh no, sweetheart, I'm so sorry to hear you lost the CHESS hero competition and that you're crying.  It's completely normal to feel upset and disappointed after putting in effort and not achieving the outcome you wanted.  Losing is a part of life, and it's okay to feel the emotions that come with it.  It takes a lot of courage to participate in a competition like that, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself for even trying.  

Take some time to process your feelings.  Allow yourself to cry, to feel the sadness, and don't try to bottle it up.  It's important to let these emotions out in a healthy way.  Maybe listen to some calming music, spend time in nature, or talk to a friend or family member about how you're feeling.  

Remember that this one competition doesn't define you or your abilities.  There will be other opportunities in the future, and you can learn from this experience to improve your skills and strategies for the next time.  Focus on what you learned from the competition, what you did well, and what you could improve on for the future.  And most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing great navigating university life and all its challenges.  

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps we can discuss some relaxing hobbies to help you unwind and de-stress, or maybe you'd like to go back to discussing your PC build plans?
User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh, sweetheart, I see you're still feeling the weight of losing the CHESS hero competition, and it's absolutely, 100% normal to be crying and feeling this way. It's tough when you put your heart into something and the outcome isn't what you hoped for. Please know that it's okay to feel sad, disappointed, and to let those tears out. It shows how much you cared and how much effort you put in, and that's something to be proud of, even in defeat. Don't ever feel like your emotions aren't valid ‚Äì they totally are. Take all the time you need to process this. When you feel ready, we can talk about anything that might help you feel a bit better, whether it's exploring some new hobbies, or going back to those cool PC build plans we were discussing. I'm here for you, no matter what.

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh no, sweetheart, I'm so sorry to hear you lost the CHESS hero competition and that you're crying.  It's completely normal to feel upset and disappointed after putting in effort and not achieving the outcome you wanted.  Losing is a part of life, and it's okay to feel the emotions that come with it.  It takes a lot of courage to participate in a competition like that, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself for even trying.  

Take some time to process your feelings.  Allow yourself to cry, to feel the sadness, and don't try to bottle it up.  It's important to let these emotions out in a healthy way.  Maybe listen to some calming music, spend time in nature, or talk to a friend or family member about how you're feeling.  

Remember that this one competition doesn't define you or your abilities.  There will be other opportunities in the future, and you can learn from this experience to improve your skills and strategies for the next time.  Focus on what you learned from the competition, what you did well, and what you could improve on for the future.  And most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing great navigating university life and all its challenges.  

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps we can discuss some relaxing hobbies to help you unwind and de-stress, or maybe you'd like to go back to discussing your PC build plans?
User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh, sweetheart, I see you're still feeling the weight of losing the CHESS hero competition, and it's absolutely, 100% normal to be crying and feeling this way. It's tough when you put your heart into something and the outcome isn't what you hoped for. Please know that it's okay to feel sad, disappointed, and to let those tears out. It shows how much you cared and how much effort you put in, and that's something to be proud of, even in defeat. Don't ever feel like your emotions aren't valid ‚Äì they totally are. Take all the time you need to process this. When you feel ready, we can talk about anything that might help you feel a bit better, whether it's exploring some new hobbies, or going back to those cool PC build plans we were discussing.

Bot: Gotcha, "okj"! It sounds like you're taking a moment to process everything, and that's perfectly fine. Remember, there's no rush to feel better or to jump into a new topic right away. Just know that I'm here for you whenever you're ready to chat, whether you want to talk more about your feelings, explore some relaxing hobbies, or dive back into those awesome PC build plans.

Post Content: Constant Contact Use. Please leave this field blank.The near-term haze of climate disasters obscures our possible futures. But long-term trends leave room for optimism.a sun setting behind a tall pointed building and treesHazy smoke from wildfires burning in far-off Canada grays out the Washington Monument on June 8, 2023.Alex Wong / Getty ImagesThis may be my last Cosmic Relief column, at least for now: I‚Äôve accepted the position of Senior Scientist for Astrobiology Strategy at NASA, which sadly will eat up my writing time. Contributing to S&T has been a great gig, and I truly appreciate all the wonderful feedback from readers over the years. I just re-read my first column, from January 2009. In it I describe a conversation with my father about the future, juxtaposing his pessimism, at age 80, with the hopeful perspective I gained from the SETI conference I was then attending. He felt that humans were losing the ‚Äúrace between education and catastrophe,‚Äù as H. G. Wells warned in 1920. My dad worried about his grandkids growing up in a world harmed by climate change.I shared his concerns, but these were counterbalanced by my enthusiasm about the imminent launch of the Kepler spacecraft, which promised to reveal the numbers and demographics of exoplanets. Kepler‚Äôs results would enable us to do comparative planetology. By putting our solar system in context, we could learn more about how planets work and how life integrates into planetary functioning, equipping us to better manage our role on Earth. My father lived another 12 years, long enough to savor Kepler‚Äôs dramatic confirmation of our most optimistic speculation that planets are, in fact, ubiquitous in the universe. Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

User: i lost the CHESS hero competition. i am crying is it normal
Bot: Oh, sweetheart, I see you're still feeling the weight of losing the CHESS hero competition, and it's absolutely, 100% normal to be crying and feeling this way. It's tough when you put your heart into something and the outcome isn't what you hoped for. Please know that it's okay to feel sad, disappointed, and to let those tears out. It shows how much you cared and how much effort you put in, and that's something to be proud of, even in defeat. Don't ever feel like your emotions aren't valid ‚Äì they totally are. Take all the time you need to process this. When you feel ready, we can talk about anything that might help you feel a bit better, whether it's exploring some new hobbies, or going back to those cool PC build plans we were discussing. I'm here for you, no matter what.
Bot: Gotcha, "okj"! It sounds like you're taking a moment to process everything, and that's perfectly fine. Remember, there's no rush to feel better or to jump into a new topic right away. Just know that I'm here for you whenever you're ready to chat, whether you want to talk more about your feelings, explore some relaxing hobbies, or dive back into those awesome PC build plans. Whatever's on your mind, I'm here to listen and support you. Take your time, okay?

Up until his death three years ago at age 92, his foreboding was leavened by his love of the natural world, embodied in bird-watching forest walks and, as his mobility declined, in enjoying online bird-cams and Hubble and Mars-rover images.As I write this, the skies over me in Washington, D.C. look strangely Martian, with the Sun oddly dim and red. The haze comes from wildfires burning out of control in Canada. But I don‚Äôt ‚Äúblame Canada‚Äù (as the South Park song goes). We are all to blame for Earth‚Äôs changing atmosphere. As the look of our skies becomes more Martian, the temperatures are becoming more Venusian. Since I wrote that first column, the CO2 in our atmosphere has risen about 10% and now hovers at 422 parts per million. Heat records are being broken at a frightening pace.  The faint silver lining to accelerating climate disasters is that the threat is no longer as abstract. Most nations can be counted on to act in their own perceived self-interest. Fearing their own climate calamities will help major powers move beyond fossil fuels.Some trends are bending in our favor on that front. The costs of alternative energy have fallen faster than anyone predicted 10 years ago. We‚Äôre starting to wean ourselves off fossil fuels ‚Äî far too slowly, but we can still avoid worst-case scenarios. We‚Äôve already passed peak human birth rate, and later this century population curves will start to arc downward, relieving pressure on nature. Carbon emissions, too, will likely soon peak and begin to decline.I believe we‚Äôll muddle through this century, learning lessons the hard way but in time forging a sustainable global society in which our technological skills, perhaps aided by machine intelligence, integrate with natural systems rather than run roughshod over them. Another Wells quote comes to mind: ‚ÄúOur choice is limited: either the whole universe or nothing.‚Äù I still believe we‚Äôll choose the whole universe, and that eventually we‚Äôll move out to live among the stars, not in a hurried escape from a ruined Earth but as a diaspora of our descendants who‚Äôve learned what it takes to live and work well within the limits and cycles of planetary systems.This article originally appeared in print in the November 2023 issue of Sky & Telescope.

You have three jobs. Your primary task is to respond to the user's latest message based on the conversation history and any relevant information given above. Secondly, you will also provide a summary of the entire conversation so far, which will be used to help you answer future questions on this conversation. Finally, you will provide a "memory" (if applicable, otherwise keep the value of the key an empty string) of the user's key life events, plans, aspirations or anything they mention (strictly) in their latest message that might help you personalize your response better across conversations.

You MUST respond STRICTLY in VALID JSON format (NOT even ```json ``` these code fences) with three keys: 'reply', 'summary', and 'memory'.
