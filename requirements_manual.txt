# **Error: `pdf2image` requires Poppler to be installed on your system.**

That's a very common error when working with `pdf2image` on Windows. The error message is telling you exactly what's wrong: the **Poppler** utility, which `pdf2image` depends on to handle PDF files, is not installed or its location is not known to your system.

Here's how to fix it.

-----

### **The Cause**

The Python library `pdf2image` is just a wrapper. It needs an actual program called **Poppler** to do the heavy lifting of reading PDFs and converting them to images. The error means Python can't find this program.

### **How to Fix It on Windows**

You need to download the Poppler utilities and tell your system where to find them by adding them to the Windows PATH.

**1. Download Poppler**

There isn't an official installer, so you'll download the pre-compiled binaries.

  * You can get the latest version from [this link](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/oGGy99/poppler-windows/releases/). Download the newest `.7z` file (e.g., `poppler-24.02.0-win.7z`). You will need a program like 7-Zip to extract it.

**2. Extract Poppler**

  * Extract the contents of the downloaded file to a permanent location on your computer. A good, simple place is directly on your C: drive, like **`C:\poppler`**.
  * After extracting, you should have a folder structure like `C:\poppler\poppler-24.02.0` which contains `bin`, `lib`, `share`, etc. For simplicity, you can rename this folder to just `poppler` so the path is `C:\poppler`. The most important sub-folder inside is **`bin`**.

**3. Add Poppler to the System PATH**

This step makes the Poppler programs available from any command prompt.

  * In the Windows search bar, type "**env**" and select "**Edit the system environment variables**".
  * In the System Properties window that opens, click the "**Environment Variables...**" button.
  * In the bottom half, under "**System variables**", find and select the variable named **`Path`**, then click "**Edit...**".
  * Click "**New**" and add the full path to the `bin` folder inside your Poppler directory. For example, if you extracted it to `C:\poppler`, you would add:
    ```
    C:\poppler\bin
    ```
  * Click OK on all the windows to close and save the changes.

**4. Restart Your Terminal**

**This is a crucial step\!** The changes to the PATH variable will not apply to any command prompt or terminal windows that are already open. **Close your current CMD/PowerShell/VS Code terminal and open a new one.**

Now, try running your script again:

```bash
(venv) C:\Users\USER\Desktop\dormitory_backend>python manage.py scrape_scholarships
```

The error should now be resolved, and the OCR process should begin.
